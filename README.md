# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 Challenge -- Supervised Machine Learning

## Instructions/Premise

In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Summary

The `credit_risk` folder contains a Jupyter Notebook `credit_risk_classification.ipynb` that performs a logistical regression analysis on a dataset of borrowers found in the `Resources` subfolder and file `lending_data.csv`.

The regression is repeated using an approach called random over-sampling in order to account for an imbalanced dataset.

The markdown file `report.md` in the `credit_risk` folder contains a thorough write-up on the analysis.

This article was extremely helpful in learning about random over-sampling, which was not covered in class but referenced in the starter workbook. 

It was very refreshing to find the concept approachable based on what we learned in class, even though we never touched on it.
